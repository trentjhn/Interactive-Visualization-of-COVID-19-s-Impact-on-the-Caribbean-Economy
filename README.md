# Interactive-Visualization-of-COVID-19-s-Impact-on-the-Caribbean-Economy

The COVID-19 Pandemic has been an unprecedented health and economic crisis with devastating effects on the Caribbean region, which is so reliant upon tourism. There is a need for analytical data to be depicted in an interactive manner, which can help identify the health and economic disparities that stem from COVID-19 in the Caribbean region. This project aims to leverage data to create interactive visualizations that illustrate the economic, touristic, and health consequences of the global pandemic. By using the D3.library in React, Caribbean economic, Covid-19, and tourism data will be visualized in various charts and graphics on a dashboard.
