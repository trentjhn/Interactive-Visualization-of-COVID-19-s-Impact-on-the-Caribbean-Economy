<h1> An Interactive Visualization of COVID-19's Impact on the Caribbean Economy</h1>
</br>
<h2>Abstract: </h2>
<p>The COVID-19 Pandemic has been an unprecedented health and economic crisis with devastating effects on the Caribbean region, which is so reliant upon tourism. Due to COVID-19, the number of international tourist arrivals declined by 73 percent in 2020, with 1 billion less travelers compared to 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization. The travel restrictions in place due to COVID-19 have had an even greater effect on the Caribbean region, which is so reliant upon tourism. In 2019, the Caribbean stood as the most travel and tourist dependent region globally, with eight out of the ten most tourism-dependent countries in the world being located within the region. For example, tourism in the Caribbean Island of St. Lucia, accounts for approximately two thirds of the countryâ€™s GDP. Like St. Lucia, many other island countries in the Caribbean have experienced a magnified economic downturn due to COVID-19.There is a need for analytical data to be depicted in an interactive manner, which can help identify the health and economic disparities that stem from COVID-19 in the Caribbean region. This project aims to leverage data to create interactive visualizations that illustrate the economic, touristic, and health consequences of the global pandemic. By using the D3.library in React, Caribbean economic, Covid-19, and tourism data will be visualized in various charts and graphs on a dashboard. It is expected that these charts will show how significant the COVID-19 pandemic was in terms of negatively affecting everyday life in the Caribbean region. The dashboard will not only allow users to see various data visualizations, but learn more about the Caribbean region overall.</p>
